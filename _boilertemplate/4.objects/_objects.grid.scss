 *** GRID OBJECT ***
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * The Grid Object is responsible for building a smart, flexible and responsive
 * grid. However you can achieve this only by Sass mixins, so basically you
 * won'tneed css classes for that, but here in Grid Object the base grid mixins
 * has already been included from Grid Tool.

 *
 * Use it when you need to use object elements for layout purposes instead of
 * `@include` grid mixins on semantic elements. There is a `.o-grid` class for
 * the flexbox based grid element (mostly the row layout element) and it's
 * direct child: `.o-grid__item` (mostly the column layout elements).
 * These elements only contains the base, you still have to write in Sass
 * the other rules, like `flex-direction` or item sizes.
 *
 * @example
 *   <div class="o-grid">
 *     <div class="o-grid__item">
 *       Column
 *     </div>
 *
 *     <div class="o-grid__item">
 *       Column
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 *
 *   .o-grid {
 *     flex-direction: row;
 *   }
 *
 *   .o-grid__item {
 *     @include breakpoint(medium) {
 *       @include column-size(6/12);
 *     }

 *     @include breakpoint(large) {
 *       @include column-size(4/12);
 *     }

 *     &--double {
 *       @include breakpoint(medium) {
 *         @include column-size(6/12);
 *       }

 *       @include breakpoint(large) {
 *         @include column-size(8/12);
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
