 *** CSS TRIANGLE TOOL ***
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * Creates a CSS triangle, which can be used for dropdown arrows, dropdown
 * pips, and more. Use this mixin inside a `&::before` or `&::after` selector,
 * to attach the triangle to an existing element.
 *
 * Borrowed from Zurb Foundation for Sites 6
 * @link https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass-mixins.html#css-triangle
 *
 * Include `stretched-link` mixin to a link (`<a>` element) to make its
 * containing block clickable via a `::after` pseudo element.
 * In most cases, this means that an element with `position: relative;` that
 * contains a link with included `stretched-link` mixin is clickable.
 *
 * @example
 *   .button__arrow {
 *     @include make-triangle(1.5rem, $color-secondary, right);
 *   }
